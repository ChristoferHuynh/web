Version of Lynis outdated, consider upgrading to the latest version
Set a password on GRUB bootloader to prevent altering boot configuration (e.g. boot in single user mode without password)
Run pwck manually and correct any errors in the password file
Install a PAM module for password strength testing like pam_cracklib or pam_passwdqc
Configure minimum password age in /etc/login.defs
Configure maximum password age in /etc/login.defs
Default umask in /etc/login.defs could be more strict like 027
To decrease the impact of a full /home file system, place /home on a separated partition
To decrease the impact of a full /tmp file system, place /tmp on a separated partition
To decrease the impact of a full /var file system, place /var on a separated partition
Disable drivers like USB storage when not used, to prevent unauthorized storage or data theft
Check DNS configuration for the dns domain name
Purge old/removed packages (10 found) with aptitude purge or dpkg --purge command. This will cleanup old configuration files, cron jobs and startup scripts.
Install debsums utility for the verification of packages with known good database.
Install package apt-show-versions for patch management purposes
Install a package audit tool to determine vulnerable packages
Check your resolv.conf file and fill in a backup nameserver if possible
Consider running ARP monitoring software (arpwatch,arpon)
Access to CUPS configuration could be more strict.
Check what deleted files are still in use and why.
Add a legal banner to /etc/issue, to warn unauthorized users
Add legal banner to /etc/issue.net, to warn unauthorized users
Enable process accounting
Enable sysstat to collect accounting (no results)
Enable auditd to collect audit information
Check output of aa-status
Install a file integrity tool to monitor changes to critical and sensitive files
Determine if automation tools are present for system management
One or more sysctl values differ from the scan profile and could be tweaked
Harden compilers like restricting access to root user only
Harden the system by installing at least one malware scanner, to perform periodic file system scans
