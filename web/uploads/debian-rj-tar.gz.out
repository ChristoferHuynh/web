PasswordAuthentication are currently set to "no". You should set it to "yes" to always use a password based authentication.
X11Forwarding is currently set to "yes". This should explicitly be set to NO, and will disable a remote X-window or X-shell to be used by an attacker.
The default port is set to 22, which the most attackers will check when they are trying to brute force login to the server using several username and password combinations. You should consider using another port to login to the server to reduce noise.
