### startup ###

The startup script expected-service should be started along the computer
The startup script bluetooth should not be started along the system
The startup script avahi-daemon should not be started along the system
Someone other than root can write to the startup script alsa-utils. This can allow attackers to take over the computer.

### sshd ###

LoginGraceTime is less than 60
StrictModes are currently set to "no". This means the server doesn't check the users permssion hme directory and rhost before they can login. You should change this to "yes".
The entry address is set at 0.0.0.0, this means it will listen to all interfaces, even external one. You should change the address to a internal one so that the server cannot be accessed from the internet unless portforwarded on the system routing.
PermitRootLogin is set to "yes" this will allow multiple sysadmins to login to the server as root and the system might not know which sysadmins are logged in as root. You should change PermitRootLogin to "no" so the sysadmins have to login to the system first using their accounts before they can do "-su".
X11Forwarding is currently set to "yes". This should explicitly be set to NO, and will disable a remote X-window or X-shell to be used by an attacker.
RSAAuthentication are currently set to "no". You should set it to "yes" to be able to use public and private key pairs created by the ssh-keygen1utility for authentication purposes.
Do not use the ports 30-60 or 2-5 for ssh
